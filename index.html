        <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the appearance of web documents written in HTML and XML. It allows web developers to apply visual styles, layout properties, and formatting to HTML elements, making it an essential tool for creating attractive and well-designed web pages.

            Here are some key points about CSS:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Separation of Style and Structure:</strong> CSS enables the separation of the content (HTML) from its presentation (styling). This separation allows for easier maintenance, flexibility, and consistency across multiple web pages.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Selectors:</strong> CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements that you want to style. Selectors can be based on element types (e.g., `p`, `h1`, `div`), class names (e.g., `.my-class`), IDs (e.g., `#my-id`), attributes, and more.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Properties and Values: </strong>CSS properties define the visual characteristics of the selected elements, such as `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `background-color`, and many others. Each property is assigned a value that determines how the element should be styled.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Box Model: </strong>The CSS box model describes how elements are rendered on a web page. It consists of the content area, padding, border, and margin. By manipulating these properties, you can control the size, spacing, and layout of elements.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Cascading and Specificity:</strong> CSS styles can be cascaded, meaning that multiple styles can be applied to the same element, with the most specific style taking precedence. Specificity determines which styles override others based on the selector's specificity.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> CSS allows for responsive web design, which means designing web pages that adapt and respond to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries in CSS enable the application of specific styles based on the characteristics of the device or screen.</li>
            
            <li><strong>CSS Preprocessors: </strong>CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less provide additional functionality and features to enhance CSS development. They offer variables, functions, mixins, nesting, and other advanced features to simplify and streamline the process of writing CSS.</li>            
            </ul>
            <p>
            By using CSS, you can transform the appearance of HTML documents, apply consistent styles across multiple pages, create responsive layouts, and customize the visual presentation to meet specific design requirements. It is a powerful tool for web designers and developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

            <h1>Advantages of CSS</h1>
            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) offers several advantages that make it an essential tool for web development:
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> CSS allows for a clear separation between the content (HTML) and the presentation (styling). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update the visual aspects of a website without affecting the underlying structure.</li>

                <li><strong>Consistent Styling:</strong> CSS enables consistent styling across multiple web pages. By defining styles in a single CSS file and linking it to multiple HTML pages, you can ensure a unified look and feel throughout your website.</li>

                <li><strong>Easy Maintenance:</strong> With CSS, you can make changes to the appearance of your website by modifying a single CSS file. This makes it efficient to update styles globally, saving time and effort.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Reusability: </strong>CSS promotes reusability by allowing you to define styles once and apply them to multiple elements throughout your website. You can create classes and IDs to target specific elements and reuse those styles as needed.</li>

                <li><strong>Flexibility and Control:</strong> CSS provides granular control over the styling of HTML elements. You can modify properties such as color, font size, margins, padding, and positioning to achieve the desired visual effects. This flexibility allows for creative and customized designs.</li>

                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> CSS enables responsive web design, allowing websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. With media queries, you can define specific styles based on the characteristics of the user's device, ensuring a consistent and optimal viewing experience.</li>

                <li><strong>Efficient File Size: </strong>CSS files are lightweight compared to inline styles or using HTML attributes for styling. By separating the styles into a separate file and caching it, you can improve website performance and reduce page load times.</li>

                <li><strong>Browser Compatibility :</strong> CSS is supported by all modern web browsers, ensuring consistent rendering across different platforms. It provides a standardized way to style web content, making it compatible with various browsers and devices.</li>

                <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> CSS can be extended using CSS frameworks and preprocessors, such as Bootstrap, Sass, or Less. These tools provide additional features, predefined styles, and a streamlined development workflow, enhancing the capabilities of CSS.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, CSS empowers web developers to create visually appealing, responsive, and well-structured websites. Its advantages in separation of concerns, flexibility, reusability, and control make it an essential technology for modern web development.</li>

            <h1>Types of CSS</h1>
            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be applied in different ways to style web documents. The following are the common types of CSS:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Inline CSS:</strong> Inline CSS is applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. This method allows you to define specific styles for a single element, but it can be cumbersome to manage and maintain, especially for larger projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Internal CSS:</strong> Internal CSS is defined within the HTML document using the &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section. Styles specified using internal CSS apply to the entire document or specific sections defined by HTML elements or class/ID selectors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>External CSS:</strong> External CSS is stored in a separate CSS file with a .css extension. This file is linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag in the <head> section. External CSS allows for the separation of styling from the content, making it easier to maintain and update styles across multiple web pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Imported CSS:</strong> Imported CSS involves using the @import rule to include an external CSS file within another CSS file. This method allows for modularization and organization of stylesheets but may result in additional HTTP requests, affecting page load times.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each type of CSS has its own advantages and use cases. External CSS is widely recommended for larger projects as it promotes maintainability and reusability, while inline and internal CSS can be suitable for smaller-scale modifications or quick styling needs.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="container-6">
    <h1>CSS Priority</h1>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) follows a specific order of priority when determining which styles should be applied to an element. The priority order, from highest to lowest, is as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Inline Styles:</strong> Inline styles have the highest priority. These are styles defined directly on individual HTML elements using the style attribute. Inline styles override all other styles, including external and internal stylesheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Internal Stylesheet:</strong> Internal stylesheets come next in priority. These are styles defined within the HTML document using the &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section. Internal stylesheets apply to the entire document or specific sections defined by HTML elements or class/ID selectors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Imported Styles:</strong> Imported styles have a priority between the internal stylesheet and the external stylesheet. Imported stylesheets are defined within the internal stylesheet using the @import rule to import another CSS file. The imported styles will be applied to the document in the order they are imported.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>External Stylesheet:</strong> External stylesheets have a lower priority. These are styles stored in separate CSS files with a .css extension. External stylesheets are linked to the HTML document using the &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section. They allow for the separation of styling from the content and can be applied to multiple web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Browser Default Styles:</strong> Browser default styles have the lowest priority. These are the default styles applied by web browsers to HTML elements if no other styles are specified. Browser default styles vary across different browsers, so it's important to reset or normalize them to achieve consistent styling.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Understanding CSS priority is crucial when dealing with conflicting styles. By considering the order of priority, you can effectively control how styles are applied to elements and ensure the desired visual appearance of your web pages.
